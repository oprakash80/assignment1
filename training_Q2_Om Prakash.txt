Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. 
Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment,making sure that there is zero downtime.


Deployments are managed by the Kubernetes Deployment controller. 
Deployments use a Pod template, which contains a specification for its Pods.
 
The Pod specification determines how each Pod should look like: what applications should run inside its containers, 
which volumes the Pods should mount, its labels, and more
